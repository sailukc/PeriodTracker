SYSTEM OVERVIEW

The Period Tracker system follows a client–server architecture. 
The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is responsible 
for displaying pages such as login, registration, dashboard, calendar, 
symptom logging, mood logging, insights, and chatbot.

The backend is built using Django and Django REST Framework. It exposes 
REST APIs for user authentication, period logs, symptom and mood logs, 
AI predictions, insights, and chatbot responses. The backend also 
handles database operations and communication with the AI models.

AI models are implemented in Python and integrated with the Django 
backend. These models use historical user data to predict cycle length, 
next period date, fertile window, ovulation, probable symptoms, and mood. 
The insights engine analyzes trends in the stored data to generate 
personalized health insights. The chatbot module uses rule-based logic 
and/or ML-based responses to answer user questions about their cycle 
and health.

The overall data flow is:
User → Frontend (HTML/JS) → Django REST API → Database + AI Models → 
Predictions & Insights → Frontend (Dashboard, Calendar, Chatbot).
